### :man_technologist: About Me :

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a **Software Engineer** with 16 years of experience, convinced **Scrum/SAFe** practitioner, currently enjoying the **full-stack JavaScript ES6+** ecosystem with focus on **testing** and scalability with **Typescript**.
- :dart: After a well-deserved sabbatical dedicated to deep dive into web development and cibersecurity tecnologies, I'm **currently looking for a job**, interested in **remote work** and **flexibility**, open to **part-time** and **travelling**.
- :arrows_counterclockwise:  I started my programming journey with C programs running in DSPs (digital signal processors) as a telecom engineer and then I spent a decade working in Datawarehousing, before I rediscovered Javascript...
- âš¡ Fun fact: I must admit that I used to have a wrongly biassed opinion about Javascript, but the ES6+ revolution was a delightful surprise and getting to know Typescript completed my full conversion :)
- ðŸ¥Š IT is both my job and my hobby. When I am not programming or learning about IT, I like to play **chess**, practice some **boxing** or enjoying a **BBQ** with my friends.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... you are always learning in this world, learning never ends!
