### :man_technologist: About Me :

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with 16 years of experience, convinced Scrum/SAFe practitioner, currently enjoying the full-stack JavaScript ES6+ and Typescript ecosystem.
- ðŸ‘¯ After a well merited sabbatical, currently looking for a job.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... you are always learning in this world, learning never ends!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I must admit that I used to have a wrongly biassed opinion about Javascript, but the ES6+ revolution was a delightful surprise and getting to know Typescript completed my full conversion :)
- ðŸ¥Š IT is both my job and my hobby. When I am not programming or learning about IT, I like to play chess, practice some boxing or enjoying a BBQ with my friends.
